            Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes
            and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are
            immersed in their surroundings. or completely different from the
            real world.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <span class="col"> Purpose of </span><span class="col1">VR</span>
          </h2>
          <p class="col1" style="line-height: 25px">
            A virtual world is a computer-based online community environment
            that is designed and shared by individuals so that they can interact
            in a custom-built, simulated world. Users interact with each other
            in this simulated world using text-based, two-dimensional or
            three-dimensional graphical models called avatars.
            <br /><br />
            VR technology continued to advance through the 21st Century as
            people began to realise how useful it could be. In addition to
            flight training, VR began to be used to train people for other
            dangerous jobs. For example, in 2019, the company Osso launched
            their own VR system. It helps surgeons practise doing dangerous
            surgeries. It was kind of like the board game Operation! There are
            many other dangerous or complicated jobs that use VR training. These
            include firefighting, wind turbine maintenance, offshore oil rig
            work, and skilled trades such as welding. As the cost of VR
            equipment comes down, more and more companies are using it to train
            their employees. For example, retail companies like WalMart and
            FedEx also offer training for front-line employees using VR.
            <br /><br />
            VR technology has the power to take us to worlds that we could not
            experience otherwise. From job sites to other planets, VR gives
            people the opportunity to experience many things in a safe way. In
            the future you may have a job in which your training is in an
            immersive virtual reality environment. You may play games or hang
            out with people. You might even explore the depths of the ocean or
            climb Mount Everest, all from the comfort of home. Virtual reality
            can take you to all sorts of interesting places today, and who knows
            where you will be able to virtually go in the future!
